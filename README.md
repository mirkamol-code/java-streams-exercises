# java-streams-exercises

A hands-on Java project focused on mastering the **Stream API** through practical, real-world style exercises.  
The goal of this repository is to practice **functional and declarative programming** using Java Streams.

## 📌 About

This project contains **20 practical exercises** based on a simple transactions dataset.  
It covers core Stream operations such as:

- `filter`
- `map`
- `flatMap`
- `sorted`
- `reduce`
- `collect`
- `groupingBy`
- `distinct`
- `anyMatch`, `allMatch`, `noneMatch`

These tasks are useful for:
- Strengthening Java functional programming skills  
- Understanding real-life stream use cases
